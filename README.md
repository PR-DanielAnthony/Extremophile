An updated version of a Global Game Jam project made in 2023 using the Unity engine, themed after Roots. Movement, collision, and shooting mechanics have been updated to work more smoothly.

You play as a mushroom that spawns platforms every time you "die". The platforms persist across deaths, which you can bounce on.

You are looking for your mushroom network, trying to reconnect your fungal self to your fungal family. Levels get trickier as you figure out the best places to "die".

You can shoot spores by pressing the `X key`, which when hitting a surface, spawns a new platform that you can bounce on. You move by holding the `left/right arrow keys`, and you jump by pressing the `space bar`.
